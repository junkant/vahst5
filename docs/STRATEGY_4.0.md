## Updated Technical Guidelines

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Svelte 5 Runes pattern we're using
class Store extends BaseStore {
  private state = $state<State>({ ... });
  
  // Always include cleanup
  cleanup() {
    // Unsubscribe from all listeners
    // Reset state
    // Call parent cleanup
  }
}
```

### Component Structure
```
component/
â”œâ”€â”€ Component.svelte    # Main component
â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts           # TypeScript types
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.ts           # Helper functions
â””â”€â”€ index.ts           # Exports
```

### Firebase Integration
- Always check auth state
- Handle offline scenarios
- Implement optimistic updates
- Use batch operations when possible

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load large components
- Compress images before upload
- Cache data in IndexedDB
- Minimize Firebase reads

## Risk Mitigation Updates

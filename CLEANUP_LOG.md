# Cleanup Log - Permission System Implementation

## Files Removed:

1. **Admin Migration Page** (no longer needed after migration):
   - `/src/routes/(app)/admin_backup/` - Migration tool

2. **Example Components** (were just for demonstration):
   - `/src/lib/components/examples/` - Example permission usage

3. **Migration Script** (one-time use):
   - `/src/lib/permissions/migration.ts` - Data migration utilities

## Files to Manually Remove:

Since I cannot delete files, please run these commands:

```bash
# Remove admin backup directory
rm -rf /Users/miran/Sites/v5/src/routes/\(app\)/admin_backup

# Remove examples directory  
rm -rf /Users/miran/Sites/v5/src/lib/components/examples

# Remove migration script
rm /Users/miran/Sites/v5/src/lib/permissions/migration.ts
```

## Files Kept But Can Be Refactored Later:

1. `/src/lib/utils/permissions.ts` - Currently provides backward compatibility
2. Old role checks in components - Need systematic replacement
